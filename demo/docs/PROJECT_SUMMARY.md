## 🎤 Suggested Opening

"Good morning/afternoon. Today I'll present my AI-driven Security Operations Center implementation. Traditional SOCs face three critical challenges: alert fatigue with analysts drowning in thousands of daily alerts, slow response times averaging 207 days to detect breaches, and a severe skilled analyst shortage with 3.4 million unfilled positions globally.

My solution integrates machine learning for threat detection, automated hunting with MITRE ATT&CK, and SOAR for instant incident response. Let me show you the live system detecting and responding to threats in real-time."

## 🎯 Suggested Closing

"In conclusion, this POC demonstrates all six learning objectives: AI-powered threat detection using Isolation Forest, automated hunting with MITRE ATT&CK, SOAR integration with five playbooks, security analytics and predictive modeling, threat intelligence integration, and compliance automation.

The key achievements are 100% automation rate, sub-minute detection and response times compared to industry averages of 207 and 73 days respectively, complete MITRE ATT&CK coverage with five major techniques, and a scalable, cloud-native architecture using 100% open-source tools.

This project proves that AI-driven security operations can dramatically improve both the speed and effectiveness of threat detection and response while reducing the burden on human analysts. Thank you, and I'm ready for your questions."
