# SECTION 1: MEDIUM QUESTIONS (50)

## Category: SOC Fundamentals

### Q1: What is the primary business problem that AI-driven SOCs solve?

**Answer:** AI-driven SOCs solve alert overload. Traditional SOCs receive 10,000+ alerts/day with 45% error rates. AI reduces this to 230 actionable threats (97.7% reduction) while achieving 96.3% detection accuracy through machine learning correlation and intelligent filtering.

---

### Q2: What are the four stages of an AI-SOC security pipeline?

**Answer:**  
1. **INGEST**: Data collection (Elastic, Splunk, Wazuh) - 1M events/sec
2. **ANALYZE**: ML analysis (TensorFlow, scikit-learn) with UEBA
3. **RESPOND**: SOAR automation (TheHive, Phantom) - <30 sec response
4. **COMPLY**: Automated reporting (Grafana) - audit-ready in 5 min

---

### Q3: What is the average cost of a data breach according to IBM's 2024 report?

**Answer:** $4.88 million USD globally (IBM Security & Ponemon Institute 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report). Includes detection, response, notification, lost business, and reputation damage. AI-SOC reduces this through 99.9% faster detection (207 days → 3 minutes).

---

### Q4: What is SOAR and what does it stand for?

**Answer:** Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response. SOAR platforms (TheHive, Phantom) automate security operations by orchestrating workflows across tools and enabling rapid response. Achieves 78% incident automation and sub-30-second response times vs. hours/days manually.

---

### Q5: What is the mean time to identify (MTTI) a breach in traditional SOCs?

**Answer:** 207 days (IBM 2024 Report) - nearly 7 months of undetected attacker access. AI-driven SOCs reduce MTTI to approximately 3 minutes through automated correlation and ML-powered anomaly detection, achieving 99.9% improvement.

---

---

# SECTION 2: ADVANCED QUESTIONS (50)

## Category: Machine Learning & Technical Implementation

### Q51: Explain LSTM networks for time-series prediction in AI-SOC

**Answer:** LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) networks are recurrent neural networks designed for sequential data analysis. In AI-SOCs, LSTM achieves 73% accuracy at 48-hour threat forecasting by analyzing historical patterns to predict:
- Ransomware deployment precursors
- Cyclical attack patterns from APT actors
- SOX 404-relevant financial system anomalies
- Insider threat escalation patterns

Implementation: TensorFlow-based models trained on 90 days of security events, continuously updated. Implements NIST CSF Protect function proactively.

---

### Q52: Compare PCI DSS Requirements 10 and 12.10

**Answer:**  
**Req 10 (Detective)** - Log all cardholder data access:
- 1M events/sec automated ingestion
- Daily log reviews via ML (10,000 → 230 alerts)
- 1-year retention (3 months readily available)

**Req 12.10 (Responsive)** - Incident response:
- SOAR playbooks (TheHive, Phantom)
- Sub-30-second automated response
- Continuous procedure testing

**Integration:** SIEM→ML→SOAR pipeline provides seamless detect-to-respond capability, exceeding both requirements.

---

### Q53: Explain One-Class SVM with RBF kernel for zero-day detection

**Answer:**  
**Technical Architecture:**
1. **Training**: Model learns boundary of "normal" behavior without anomaly examples
2. **RBF Kernel**: K(x,y) = exp(-γ||x-y||²) maps data to higher dimensions  
3. **Detection**: Events outside learned boundary = anomalies
4. **No Signatures**: Identifies statistical deviations, not known patterns

**Effectiveness:**
- 89% zero-day detection accuracy
- Implements NIST SP 800-53 SI-4 (unknown attack monitoring)
- Detects polymorphic malware, novel exploits, APT techniques
- Continuous learning adapts to environment changes

2. Patch vulnerability exploited
3. Deploy new detection rule (prevent recurrence)
4. User training (phishing awareness)

**Compliance (Hour 4-24):**
- GDPR Article 33: No personal data exfiltrated, no notification required
- PCI DSS 12.10: Incident documented, response tested
- SOX 404: Financial systems unaffected
- Post-incident report generated automatically

**Outcome:**

- Access during business hours (9 AM - 5 PM)
- Standard tools: SQL Management Studio

**Anomaly Detection (Days 31-45):**
```
UEBA Flags:
Day 32: 75 records accessed (+50% increase) - Risk: 35
Day 35: 150 records accessed (+200%) - Risk: 55
Day 38: 500 records accessed (+900%) - Risk: 75
Day 40: Access at 2 AM (unusual time) - Risk: 85
Day 43: External USB device connected - Risk: 92
Day 45: 5,000 records exported to CSV - Risk: 96
```

**Automated Response (Day 45, Hour 2 AM):**
```

2. Read-only access enforced (prevent further export)
3. Session monitoring intensified (screen recording)
4. Supervisor notification
5. Security team emergency alert
6. Endpoint quarantine (prevent USB data transfer)
```

**Investigation (Day 45, 8 AM):**
1. Interview DBA: Claims "performance testing" (inconsistent with evidence)
2. Forensics: USB drive contained 50,000 customer records
3. Financial investigation: DBA recently applied to competitor
4. Evidence: Competitor hiring email found

**Response:**
1. Immediate termination
2. Credentials revoked across all systems
3. Legal action initiated (theft of trade secrets)
4. Customer notification (GDPR breach)
5. Law enforcement contacted

**Compliance:**

2. Data exfiltration DLP rules (block large exports)
3. USB device lockdown
4. Enhanced background checks for privileged users

**Outcome:**
- Data recovered: 95% (from customer's USB)
- Legal: DBA prosecution, competitor investigation

6. Create incident case in TheHive
```

**Investigation (Hour 1-4):**
1. Malware analysis: Cryptocurrency miner + data exfiltration
2. Impact assessment: 3 developer workstations infected
3. Scope: No production systems affected (CI/CD caught it)
4. IOCs extracted: C2 domains, wallet addresses, file hashes

**Remediation:**
```
Actions:
1. Remove malicious package from all systems
2. Rotate all API keys (assume compromised)
3. Scan repositories for hardcoded secrets
4. Revert to known-good package version
5. Update package lock files
```

**Prevention (Post-Incident):**
1. Implement package allowlist (only approved packages)
2. SCA scans mandatory in CI/CD pipeline
3. SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) generation
4. Dependency signing verification
5. Air-gapped build environment

**Compliance:**
- NIST SP 800-161: Supply chain risk management ✓
- EO 14028: SBOM requirement for software ✓
- PCI DSS 6.2: Secure software development ✓

**Outcome:**
- Production impact: Zero (caught in dev)
