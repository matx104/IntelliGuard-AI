   - Focus on questions you got wrong
   - Use flashcard apps (Anki) for key stats

2. **Chunking**
   - Group related questions (e.g., all GDPR questions together)
   - Study one chunk per session
   - Connect concepts (e.g., GDPR Article 33 ‚Üí SOAR response)

3. **Active Recall**
   - Don't just read answers‚Äîquiz yourself
   - Cover answers, try to recall from memory
   - Explain concepts in your own words

4. **Elaborative Rehearsal**
