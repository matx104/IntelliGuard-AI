## 💡 Study Tips

### Memorization Techniques

1. **Spaced Repetition**
   - Review questions: Day 1, Day 3, Day 7, Day 14
   - Focus on questions you got wrong
   - Use flashcard apps (Anki) for key stats

2. **Chunking**
   - Group related questions (e.g., all GDPR questions together)
   - Study one chunk per session
   - Connect concepts (e.g., GDPR Article 33 → SOAR response)

3. **Active Recall**
   - Don't just read answers—quiz yourself
   - Cover answers, try to recall from memory
   - Explain concepts in your own words

4. **Elaborative Rehearsal**
   - Connect new info to existing knowledge
   - Example: "LSTM is like remembering patterns over time, just like how I debug production incidents by looking at historical logs"

### Understanding vs. Memorization

**Memorize:**
- Key statistics (207 days, $4.88M, 256% ROI)
- Framework article numbers (GDPR 33, PCI DSS 10)
- MITRE technique IDs (T1055-T1570)

**Understand:**
- Why AI-SOC is better than traditional SOC (conceptual)
- How ML models work (high-level, not mathematical proofs)
- Business value proposition (ROI drivers)
