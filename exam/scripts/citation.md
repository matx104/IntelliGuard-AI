## ACADEMIC INTEGRITY NOTES

### What Counts as Proper Citation:

✅ **Good:**
- "According to IBM's 2024 Cost of a Data Breach Report..."
- "Ponemon Institute research shows..."
- "As mandated by PCI DSS requirement 10..."
- "NIST Special Publication 800-53 control SI-4 requires..."

✅ **Acceptable:**
- "Industry research indicates..." (if multiple sources confirm)
- "Regulatory frameworks such as GDPR Article 32 require..."

❌ **Avoid:**
- "Studies show..." (too vague)
- "It is well known that..." (not specific)
- "Experts agree..." (who?)
- Exact quotes without attribution

### When You Can Use Round Numbers:

- **Exact figures:** Use when available (e.g., $4.88M, not "about $5M")
- **Approximations:** OK for ranges (e.g., "10,000+" if report says 10,000-11,000)
- **Averages:** OK to round (e.g., "207 days" is average of 206.8 days)

### If You Cannot Access a Source:

**Options:**
1. Use secondary citation: "As reported by [Source A], [Source B] found that..."
2. Remove the specific statistic and use general statement
3. Find alternative source with similar finding
4. Note limitation: "While I couldn't verify the exact figure..."

**Never:**
- Make up access to sources you haven't seen
- Cite sources you found through Wikipedia without verifying
- Use statistics without understanding their methodology
